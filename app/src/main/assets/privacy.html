If this does occur, we’ll take extra care to ensure your privacy rights are protected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accidents or incidents</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an accident or incident occurs on our property, at one of our events or involving one of our staff then we’ll keep a record of this (which may include personal data and sensitive personal data).</span></p>

</ul>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DISCLOSING AND SHARING DATA</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Occasionally, where we partner with other organisations, we may also share information with them (for example, if you register to attend an event being jointly organised by us and another organisation). We’ll only share information when necessary and we will never share your contact information (e.g. email or telephone).</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MARKETING</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demos will ask for individuals to “opt-in” for most communications. This includes all our marketing communications (the term marketing is broadly defined and covers information shared in our newsletter.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use personal data to communicate with people, to promote Demos and to help with fundraising activities. This includes keeping you up to date with information from Demos on our research, events, news, job opportunities and other information relating to our work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can decide not to receive communications or change how we contact you at any time. If you wish to do so please contact us by emailing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hello@demos.co.uk,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> writing to Demos, 76 Vincent Square, London SW1P 2PD or telephoning 020 3878 3955 (Lines open 9.30am – 6pm, Mon – Fri).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does ‘marketing’ mean?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing does not just mean offering things for sale, but also includes news and information about:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our research programme, including details of recent reports or blogs;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our events and activities; and</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">job opportunities.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you receive a communication, we may collect information about how you respond to or interact with that communication, and this may affect how we communicate with you in future.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HOW WE PROTECT DATA</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We employ a variety of physical and technical measures to keep your data safe and to prevent unauthorised access to, or use or disclosure of your personal information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electronic data and databases are stored on secure computer systems and we control who has access to information (using both physical and electronic means). Our staff receive data protection training and we have a set of detailed data protection procedures which personnel are required to follow when handling personal data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment security</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All electronic Demos forms that request financial data use pass your details to our payment provider (Stripe Payments Europe: </span><a href="https://stripe.com/gb/privacy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://stripe.com/gb/privacy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; </span><a href="https://stripe.com/privacy-shield-policy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://stripe.com/privacy-shield-policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Demos complies with the payment card industry data security standard (PCI-DSS) published by the PCI Security Standards Council, and will never store card details. If you would rather make a payment through BACS or by cheque please contact us by emailing hello@demos.co.uk, writing to Unit 1, Lloyd’s Wharf, 2-3 Mill Street, London SE1 2BD or telephoning 020 3878 3955 (Lines open 9.30am – 6pm, Mon – Fri).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, we cannot guarantee the security of your home computer or the internet, and any online communications (e.g. information provided by email or our website) are at the user’s own risk.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">STORAGE</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where we store information</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demos’ operations are based in England and we store our data within the European Union.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How long we store information</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will only use and store information for so long as it is required for the purposes it was collected for. How long information will be stored for depends on the information in question and what it is being used for. For example, if you ask us not to send you marketing emails, we will stop storing your emails for marketing purposes (though we’ll keep a record of your preference not to be emailed).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We continually review what information we hold and delete what is no longer required. We never store payment card information.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">KEEPING YOU IN CONTROL</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to ensure you remain in control of your personal data. Part of this is making sure you understand your legal rights, which are as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right to confirmation as to whether or not we have your personal data and, if we do, to obtain a copy of the personal information we hold (this is known as subject access request);</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right to have your data erased (though this will not apply where it is necessary for us to continue to use the data for a lawful reason);</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right to have inaccurate data rectified;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the right to object to your data being used for marketing or profiling; and</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">where technically feasible, you have the right to personal data you have provided to us which we process automatically on the basis of your consent or the performance of a contract. This information will be provided in a common electronic format.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please keep in mind that there are exceptions to the rights above and, though we will always try to respond to your satisfaction, there may be situations where we are unable to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you would like further information on your rights or wish to exercise them, please write to Demos’ Head of External Affairs, 76 Vincent Square, London, SW1P 2PD or by email; hello@demos.co.uk</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complaints</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can complain to Demos directly by contacting our Head of External Affairs using the details set out above.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not happy with our response, or you believe that your data protection or privacy rights have been infringed, you can complain to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office which regulates and enforces data protection law in the UK.

<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note on compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation as pertaining to use of social media data within Demos projects</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Centre for the Analysis of Social Media (CASM) often conducts research which involves the collection and analysis of publicly available data from social media platforms.&amp; Much of this data, including usernames, is considered personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In order to ensure this data is processed lawfully and transparently, the following procedures are followed by CASM projects undertaken by Demos:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All data collected from social media platforms is accessed through the official application programming interface (API) of that platform, and stored and used in compliance with that API’s terms of service.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data is only collected from platforms for which users have provided clear consent, as defined in Article 4(11) of the GDPR, to provide that platform with published data</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CASM often applies techniques in artificial intelligence to social media data, in order to conduct research on this data. As we have throughout our history as a research centre, we ensure that the reasons for applying these techniques, the methodology used to analyse data, and the conclusions drawn from our analysis are presented clearly and fully in each report. This includes publishing detailed accuracy scores for any machine learning algorithms applied as part of the research.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This data is securely stored on a monitored server, accessible only to CASM staff, and encrypted in transit. In the event that a data breach is discovered, CASM will act swiftly to ensure that damage from this breach is minimised, including informing relevant supervisory authorities and acting to identify and resolve any security issues allowing the breach.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demos will maintain a publicly accessible page on its website for each project, explaining the sources and character of data collected for that project, the purposes for which this data will be used, and including contact details for a designated member of staff responsible for responding to public queries about this data.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data collected from social media sites is not stored for longer than is necessary to complete each project</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to respect the rights of data controllers to maintain control of their personal data, CASM will remove from any dataset personal data pertaining to an individual who requests such deletion. This includes taking reasonable measures to ensure that content deleted from social media platforms is also removed from datasets used by CASM.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CASM does not publish any personal data collected during its research, nor is personal data shared with third parties external to CASM or transferred out of the UK, without the explicit consent of the data subject. Any data published or shared with a third party is aggregated, anonymised or altered to prevent identification a natural person.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where quotes from social media users are published in reports, these quotes are bowdlerised – altered in a way which preserves meaning but prevents retroactive identification of the original post through e.g an online search. An occasional exception to this policy is observed when the user is publically known to the extent that they would not reasonably expect their social media posts to be private. It should be noted here that the GDPR only applies to natural persons, and not companies or organisations.</span></li>
</ul>
